  /**
   * What does the model represent?
   *
   * The model should be able to support various kinds of 2D shapes, although currently we have
   * described only rectangles and ovals.
   *
   * The model should support at least describing the size, position, and color of shapes, though
   * you might support additional features.
   *
   * Remember to think from not only the implementor’s perspective (the person that is implementing
   * the model) but also the client perspective (the people or classes that are using the model).
   * What operations might they reasonably want to perform? What observations might they reasonably
   * want to make?
